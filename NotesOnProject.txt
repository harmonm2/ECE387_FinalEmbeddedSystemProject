Project Progress

Day 1
- designed environment, enemies, and player
- defined environment in Arduino by creating char array of pixel values either 0 or 1
- drafted code for intializing menu and environment
- drafted code for player movement using buttons
- created a separate module to test the GPS 
-  created a separate module to test the Pedometer

Day 2
- created a seprate module to test the Joystick
- wired all connections, used modules to test the funtionality of all parts
- created menu screen
- start button takes you to the game screen
- discovered multiple limitations with the LCD
	- [1] can only define eight specialized characters
		- consequently the obstacles I designed could not be added in the game
	- [2] the LiquidCrystal library is very basic
		- this led to problems implementing a redraw function into the game
			- the problem appeared when changing from one specialized character frame to the next
			- consequently the background of the game was removed and then use setCursor method to move circle around with Joystick
- Miami Gym GPS coordinates
	- const double gymLatitude = 39.502752;
	- const double gymLongitude = -84.737871;
- discovered limitations with the GPS
	- [1] need to be outside to get a "fix" / long, lat coordinates
